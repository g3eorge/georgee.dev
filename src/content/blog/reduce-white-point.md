Your iPhone includes a little-known accessibility feature called Reduce White Point. I recommend setting it to 50% as a baseline, but you can adjust it based on the lighting of your environment. Note that using this setting might make viewing in the sunlight harder.

## How to find the setting

1. Open _Settings_

2. Select _Accessibility_

3. Select _Display & Text Size_

## A step further: accessibility shortcut

If youâ€™d like to toggle this feature quickly, you can configure Accessibility Shortcut:

1. Open _Settings_

2. Select _Accessibility_

3. Select _Accessibility Shortcut_

4. Toggle _Reduce White Point_
