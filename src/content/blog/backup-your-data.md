If your photo library suddenly vanished, how would you feel? Most people would understandably be outraged. As such, everybody should make efforts to protect themselves from data loss.

Many providers attempt to reassure users their data is safe inside the cloud. But what if that cloud goes down? What if you get banned for a false reason?

Copy all of your salient photos/documents into a local folder. This will give you a local backup of your key photos while letting you take advantage of the convenience of the cloud.
