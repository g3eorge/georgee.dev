My keyboard setup is not conventional. Today, I would like to share the keyboard modifications I use.

This article is organized from normal to abnormal. I hope it provides value and a good starting point for beginners.

## Hyper Key

`Caps lock -> Cmd+Ctrl+Shift+Option`

This simple modification unlocks significant power. Since I enabled it, I have activated many more Hyper Key shortcuts, so I will inevitably run out of basic letter combinations. Raycast manages most of my key functionality.

## Better ctrl+tab

Hyper+Tab -> Ctrl+Tab

This modification makes using Ctrl+Tab much easier. In most macOS-based browsers, Ctrl+Tab switches tabs by the most recently used. Some browsers on other platforms offer similar functionality.

## More reachable page up and down

Hyper-(U/O) -> Page Up/Down

I should probably use this more instead of my mouse.

## Lock key

`del_forward -> [lock shortcut for your os]`

While I mostly use the regular lock shortcut, having a dedicated key is sometimes handy. My Keychron keyboard came with a lock keycap, which inspired me to create this.

## Home-row arrow keys

`Hyper+(h/j/k/l) -> Left/Down/Up/Right`

This one takes some time to get used to. I had to disable my regular arrow keys until I nailed my muscle memory with this. Getting used to this new combination had a noticeable impact on my speed.

## New tabs

`Hyper (if alone) -> Cmd+T`

I haven't fully gotten used to this modification. I am not noticing a worthy impact, so I cannot recommend it yet.

## Backspace

`; -> Backspace`

I do not recommend this to anybody. This was a dumb experiment from months ago that stuck in my muscle memory. I guess it helps a tiny bit ðŸ™ƒ

If you're wondering how I type a regular semicolon, I configured Cmd+; as the method.
